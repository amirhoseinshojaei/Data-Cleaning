# Data Cleaning & Standardization ProjectsðŸ˜Ž


---

This repository contains two essential data preparation tasks often required in the data analysis pipeline: Data Cleaning and Standardizing Data. These steps are vital for ensuring high-quality, consistent, and reliable datasets for subsequent analysis.

## Projects

 1. DataCleaning Project:

     Data cleaning is the process of identifying and rectifying issues in a dataset to improve its quality. This includes handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and ensuring proper formatting.

### Features:


- Handling Missing Values: Identifies and fills or removes missing data using various techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).


- #### Removing Duplicates: Detects and removes duplicate rows to ensure unique entries.

- Fixing Inconsistencies: Standardizes values (e.g., correcting typos, harmonizing categories).

 ## Standardizing Data Project
Data standardization ensures that the data follows a consistent format across all variables, making it easier for analysis, reporting, and further processing.

Features:

- Standardizing Date Formats: Converts all date fields to a consistent format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

- Scaling Numerical Data: Normalizes numerical columns using standard techniques like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.

- Text Normalization: Standardizes text fields by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, and trimming unnecessary spaces.

- Categorical Encoding: Converts categorical variables into a standard encoding format (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
